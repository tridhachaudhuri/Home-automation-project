# Home-automation-project
This is an IoT project on home automation. There are 4 parts to this project. The first is knowing if a person is at our door using a PIR sensor. Next is, if there is smoke in the house then the fire department is sent a message noting the same. Thirdly, a person is able to turn the lights on and off by using an Ethernet shield. Lastly, the temperature of an appliance is checked and sent to the cloud. If its more than necessary then a message is sent to the person.
